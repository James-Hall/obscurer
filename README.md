# Obscurer

## Cowrie Honeypot Obscurer (2020)

A Python script designed to remove (nearly) all default values from a Cowrie Honey Pot installation. 

A random host profile with new users, hostname, groups, file shares, harddrive(s) sizes, mounts, cpu, ram, OS version, IP address, MAC addresses and SSH version is created. In theory this makes it much harder to easily detect default cowrie honeypot installations.

This script will work best with new installations of Cowrie, with unedited configurations.

## Requirements

* Fresh Cowrie install (no edited configurations or files)
* Python 3

## Usage

```
python obscurer.py [options] path/to/cowrie/directory

Options:
  -h, --help    Show this help message and exit
  -a, --allthethings  Change all of the default values
  
Example:
./obscurer.py -a /home/cowrie/cowrie/
```

Once the script has completed restart the Cowrie service and SSH to the host to confirm changes have been made.
